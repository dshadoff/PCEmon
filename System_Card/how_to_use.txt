These are IPS files to patch a (Super)CD-ROM system Card J/(U?).pce file with.
Please make sure the system card has NO 512-byte header (ie: if $000-$1FF of
your system card ROM consists mostly of zeroes, cut it out!)
Headers on a PCE ROM are completely useless these days.

I've included IPS patch files, because the PCE system card is still technically
under copyright.  Find out how to use an IPS patcher.

PCEmon is embedded in a normal system card, and will be called up by pressing
RUN+SELECT or just SELECT (depending on which version of the IPS you used)
almost anytime during the game.  You'll then have to unplug your joypad and
plug in your RS-232 cable.  This swapping is unavoidable for now, I believe.

Some games swap out the system card altogether, so you won't be able to use
PCEmon with them.

Anyhow, if you can't get IPS patches to work, please e-mail me.  The hacking and
additional code I put into the System Card is a little too complex to post here
briefly enough.

In addition, I filled $002A000 in the system card with 8K from my PCEmon_SHORT.pce
ROM.  The system card mostly has bank $15 free, so that's where PCEmon is mapped!

** UPDATE **

I've also included a cheat menu in the RUN+Select version of the System Card.
Press Select at the usual CD Card boot screen to access it.
